## About

Programmed in [Java](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk), for [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org/)/[Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/),
this plugin provides functionality for users who prefer to play on Bukkit servers with plugins designed for the Bukkit API, rather than limiting themselves to Fabric mod servers. In order for users to enjoy this translation layer, [Ping Wheel](https://github.com/LukenSkyne/Minecraft-Ping-Wheel) must still be installed on a Fabric instance.


## How to use the plugin?

1. Go to the [latest version](https://github.com/RXJpaw/Minecraft-Ping-Wheel-Plugin/releases/latest).
2. Download `Ping-Wheel-Plugin-X.X.X-bukkit-Y.Y.Y.jar`.
3. Put the .jar in your server's `/plugin`-directory for Ping Wheel-users to enjoy!
